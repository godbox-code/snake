- while i thought that this woudl provide a challange i didnt think it would provide this much. as always i recode things a million times, because i dont like that way my code looks. although i do belive i am making progress in how code should be structured. i do need to put more time into thinking about the completed project at the start, rather than thinking that i can just make the pieces fit later. live and learn....
